          A Python project that uses Qt for its graphics and allows the user to
          train and run a Tensorflow neural network model to read handwriting
          from any natural language. This started as my senior thesis, but I've
          spent a little time refactoring it and hope to make it significantly
          more useable eventually. The neural network design is in a paper cited
          on the Github page accessible by clicking on the name of the project.

          So far, we have tested this project with pre-standardized Spanish,
          modern (yet not contemporary) German, contemporary Japanese,
          contemporary English, and Nahuatl, all to varying degrees of success
          which is likely due to the complexity of the characters, the size of
          the character set, and the amount of training time.

          A JavaScript project (I think this is my first project in JavaScript)
          that uses React for its frontend and NodeJS for its backend. There are
          a few quirks about this project, likely because this was done for a
          hackathon and needed to interface between both Python and JavaScript,
          although the majority of the project is in JavaScript with just a
          command line script running with Python. Admittedly, this project has
          not been well maintained, so feel free to try it with the warning that
          it might not work properly or at all. Click the project's name to go
          to its Github page and look around or download the project to see what
          it does.
