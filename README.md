# This is my personal site!

If you're wondering why the code is the way it is (i.e. VERY BAD), it's because
I thought it would be funny. It's not as bad as it could be, though "good" isn't
exactly a word I would use to describe the current state. Maybe I'll come back
and actually fix it sometime in the future. Until that time, however, feel free
to laugh at the code with me. It's goofy by design.
